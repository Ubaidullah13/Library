# Virtual Library in AR/VR

## Overview
This project is a virtual library simulation developed in Unity with a focus on AR/VR capabilities. It was created as a semester project to provide users with an immersive, interactive experience, allowing them to interact with a virtual environment through intuitive controls and realistic physics.

## Features
- **User Interaction**: Pick up books, turn on a laptop, and interact with various elements within the library space.
- **Movement Options**: Navigate the space with either joystick-based movement or teleportation for more natural VR engagement.
- **Physics Integration**: Applied physics to books and other interactive elements for a realistic experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Unity** with AR/VR packages
- **Blender** for minor 3D asset creation and adjustments

## Challenges and Solutions
### Integration Challenges: 
Integrating different components for seamless interaction was challenging. We resolved this by breaking down the interactions into smaller functions and testing each feature independently to identify conflicts.

### Physics Optimization: 
Applying physics to all interactive items slowed down performance initially. We optimized by selectively applying physics only when the item was interacted with.
